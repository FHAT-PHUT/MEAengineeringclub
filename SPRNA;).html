            Congrats for completing the “fun way” to learn about the MEA
            Engineering club! At our club, we learn about engineering related
            things in a (hopefully) entertaining way! To be honest, it's really
            difficult. Especially because there are so many different aged
            students going to my club. So bear with me if it gets a little slow
            sometimes… though hopefully that never will happen. Congrats again
            on finding this!
            <!--If you are a little older, you might find some of the things on “Nerdy Stuff” interesting, so take a look at it if you have the time! -->
          </p>

            As prize for finding all these secrets, here are some engineering
            related jokes:
            <br />

            <br />
            <b>Joke 1: </b>
            <br />
            An engineer, a statistician, and a physicist are out hunting. They
            spot a buck, and each take turns to try and bag it. The physicist
            goes first. He pulls out his lab book and quickly calculates the
            trajectory of the bullet, assuming it is a perfect sphere in a
            vacuum. The bullet falls 20m short of the deer.
            <br /><br />
            The engineer goes second. He pulls out his engineer's pad and book
            of projectile assumptions. After a few minutes he’s ready, he takes
            aim, and fires. The bullet lands 20m passed the deer.
            <br /><br />
            The statistician leaps in the air shouting, “We got it!”
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Joke 2: </b>
            <br />
            A priest, a doctor, and an engineer were waiting one morning for a
            particularly slow group of golfers. The engineer fumed, "What's with
            those guys? We must have been waiting for fifteen minutes!" The
            doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such inept
            golf!"
            <br /><br />
            The priest said, "Here comes the green-keeper. Let's have a word
            with him." He said, "Hello George, what's wrong with that group
            ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?"
            <br /><br />
            The group fell silent for a moment. The priest said, "That's so sad.
            I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight." The doctor
            said, "Good idea. I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist colleague
            and see if there's anything he can do for them."
            <br /><br />
            The engineer said, "Why can't they play at night?"
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <b>Joke 3: </b>
            <br /><br />
            A farmer challenges an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician to
            fence off the largest amount of area using the least amount of
            fence.
            <br /><br />
            The engineer made his fence in a circle and said it was the most
            efficient. The physicist made a long line and said that the length
            was infinite. Then he said that fencing half of the earth was the
            best.
            <br /><br />
            The mathematician laughed at the others and, with his design, beat
            them in the challenge. What did he do?
            <br /><br />
            He decided to build a fence around himself. Then, he claimed he was
            outside of the fence.
