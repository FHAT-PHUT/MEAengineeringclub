							<h3>Welcome to the second secret page!</h3>
						</header>
						<p>HEY HEY HEY, YOU FOUND ME! Ok, this is the second secret page containing information about the engineering club:</p>


						<p>
							Soon after the club was founded, we had our first meeting. It wasn't anything too exciting, just a little introduction, and a discussion on what we wanted to start the year off with. 
							I had planned a few ideas, and if we were to use CAD, I wanted to do it through autodesk inventor. Typically, it would cost ~ $2,000 per year, but for high school students, it would be free. There was a slight oversight, something I hadn't thought ofâ€”half the members were in elementary school, and the free student version of CAD was only available to high schoolers. 
							And so, I learned how to use tinkerCAD. No joke, I had never used tinkerCAD before then. So with that, we started the club. You can view some of the things we made under 
							<a href="pastprojects.html" >Projects,</a>
							as I am sure you know by now. Soon we plan to be moving on to circuitry and arduinos, something which I really look forward to! 

						
						</p>
						<p>And with that, there is one more page for you to find. Meanwhile, I would love it if you could give me some feedback on how you like my website thusfar (wink wink). On a completely unrelated note, here's a question/riddle for you to chew on: </p>
						
						<p><i>Slick and slimy, these beasts eat all which they can.. These omnivorous animals eat even humans, yet they are typically less than two feet long. If you filled out my first form, you might remember this animal. One student responded saying that they were allergic to these. Anyway, good luck with figuring this out, and make sure not to stick your hand in the water...</i></p>
