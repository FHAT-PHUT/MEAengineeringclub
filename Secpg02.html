							<h3>Welcome to the second secret page!</h3>
						</header>
						<p>HEY HEY HEY, YOU FOUND ME! Ok, this is the second secret page containing information about the engineering club:</p>


						<p>
							On the first page, we talked about the founding of the engineering club.
							But what came after? Well, next was our first meeting.
							It wasn't anything too exciting, just some introductions and a discussion on how we were going to start off the club. 
							My plan at that time was to do CAD (Computer-aided design), through autodesk inventor. Typically, it would cost ~ $2,000 per year, but for high school students, it would be free. There was a slight oversight—something I hadn't thought of: half the members were in elementary school, and the free version of CAD was only available to high schoolers. 
							And so, we swapped to tinkerCAD (with the high school students still using Inventor). Meeting two we had an introduction to CAD, and the week after we started our first project, which can be seen under
							<a href="pastprojects.html" >Past Meetings and Projects.</a>
							Soon we plan to be moving on to circuitry and arduinos (which are like codeable circuit boards)!

						
						</p>
						<p>And with that, there is one more page for you to find. Meanwhile, I would love it if you could give me some feedback on how you like my website thusfar (wink wink). On a completely unrelated note, here's a question/riddle for you to chew on: </p>
						
						<p><i>Slick, scaly and slimy, these beasts eat all which they "feel" with their lateral line system. These creatures are omnivorous—able to eat even humans, yet they are typically less than two feet long. If you filled out my first form, you might remember this animal. Good luck with figuring this out, and make sure not to stick your hand in the water...</i></p>
