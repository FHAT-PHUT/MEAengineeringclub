							, and one week this happened to me. I was likely singing horribly off tune when I was struck by a rather persistant thoughtâ€”that it would be sick to start an engineering club at our school. I sent a few emails, and afterwards the club was founded! This was shortly after Mr. Sheahan became the new physics teacher at MEA, and he graciously agreed to be the advisor for the club! Then, the club started, which I will tell you more about on the next secret page!
