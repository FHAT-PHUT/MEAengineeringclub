							<h3>What is the Engineering Club?</h3>
						</header>
							<p>
								So... I promised you answers, and answers you shall get. 
								Before you do, however, I wanted to make this a little more interesting. 
								You have two choices: you can learn about the club the fun way, 
								or you can click that button below this to learn about the club the boring way… 
								the choice is yours. 
							</p>
							<p> 
								If you want to learn about the club the fun way, here is your first hint: <i>When the sun goes down, you flick me on. You probably use me every day. Press me until I light the way.</i> </p>

							<p class="disappearingText">So you decided to learn about the club the boring way… welp, that's ok, I am sure you are very busy. Well, lets get on it then. A few months ago, I thought it would be a good idea to start an engineering club here at MEA. I mean, what better time than a pandemic to start something new? We started in month four (if I remember correctly), and have thus far been focusing on CAD (more about that on the projects page). The current plan is to continue with CAD design for the next few weeks, then to move on to arduinos and circuitry. If that sounds in any way interesting to you, I hope that you can join us in some future meetings!</p>
