							In this meeting, we went over the basics of CAD. So, what is CAD? CAD stands for Computer-assisted design, and it has a myriad of applications in the many fields of engineering. At the engineering club, we are using the program TinkerCAD to start off. The members in high school have been following along with Autodesk Inventor—a professional grade 3D design software program, which students can get for free.

							To sum up the meeting, TinkerCAD has a range of blocks which can be dragged and dropped into the field. After being placed, the blocks can be changed and manipulated. There are some more complex pieces, but learning how to use them all pretty much comes with time. If you want to learn more about tinkerCAD, email me, or join us at the next meeting!

							<br> Inventor is a little more advanced. To use it, the first thing you need to do is click the “Start 2D sketch button” in the top left of the screen. Then, you would pick a plane from what should look something like the image below: 
							<img src="images/IntroCAD_Image_2.png" alt="IntroCAD2" width="700" >
							<br>
							Then, you can start your sketch. Whatever you sketch here, you can later “extrude” into the 3rd dimension. After you finish your sketch, press the “finish sketch” button in the top right corner. Then, next to the “Start 2D sketch”, click the “extrude” button. 
							<br><br>

							<br>
							This gives you a few options. First, you would select a face to extrude, then a direction to extrude in. Under output, you have some boolean options. The first two are the most commonly used, allowing you to switch between a solid or a hole. After making an extrusion, you can then select it’s faces to make sketches off of. There's a lot more to Inventor (like dimensions and such), and if you want to learn more about it, feel free to email me at any time. 
							<br> 
							<br> 
							With both of these programs, amazing things can be made. CAD has limitless possibilities and applications. Even outside of specific engineering fields, some examples of this include using CAD in

							In summary, CAD is a really cool way to make abstract ideas and concepts come to life!

							This meeting was where we first started to put our CAD skills into practice. Our goal was to design 3D models of cars, with a cut out of a pipe running through the back (see image below) and up through a nozzle. After 3D printing the cars, a balloon would be attached to the nozzle, propelling the car forward. 
							<br><br>
							<img src="images/BalloonCar_Image_1.png" alt="Car1" Width=700>
							The car chassis would have two holes through the side, for the axles to connect through, and wheels would be designed to attach as well (it wouldn’t be a good car without any wheels, afterall).  The result would look something like this:

							During the fourth week, I 3D printed some of the student’s cars, and we raced them virtually. Two of the cars can be seen up top, which were made by Marco and Vasco Klap.

							On the fifth meeting (2/1/2021) we designed some model houses. The example house I designed was made to scale up to what a real house would be like <!--(You can read more about the real-life connections under #NerdStuff) -->. This meeting  was a little less structured, with me explaining what I was doing as we went, and students following along making whatever creative changes they deemed worthy (as can be seen above, in a model house made by Emma Viglotti). I started with a 150 x 120 x 24 mm box, and cut out a portion of it to make an L shape. Then, part of the L shape was hollowed out, making a garage. 
							<br>

							<br>
							Afterwards, roofs were added using two triangles, an area was cut out for the porch, and a little outline was made to indicate a door. 
							<br>
							<img src="images/House_Image_2.png" alt="House3" Width=700>
							<br>
							Then I added a window, and some solar panels (cause why not). At this point, one student informed me that I could change the color of the house by clicking the “solid” button in the block options menu. And so, my new beautiful pink house was finished. But it still needed something… so I added a shower to the garage. As for why... Well, why not?
