          <br />
          In this meeting, we went over the basics of Computer-aided design,
          or CAD. CAD has a myriad of applications in most of the many fields
          of engineering. At our club, we are starting off with the free
          online tool TinkerCAD to create models. The high schoolers are using
          Autodesk Inventor, a professional-grade 3D designing software which
          students can get for free.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="images/IntroCAD_Image_1.png" alt="IntroCAD1" />
          <br /><br />
          TinkerCAD has a variety of blocks which can be dragged and dropped
          into the workplane field. After being placed, they can be
          manipulated in various ways (resized, moved, etc) depending on the
          type of block picked. There are several more complex blocks which
          can be more confusing to use, but learning how to use them comes
          with practice.
          <br />
          ----------

          <br />
          Inventor is a little more advanced. To use it, first click the
          “Start 2D Sketch" button in the top left of the screen; Then, pick a
          plane to start your sketch on, from what should look something like
          the image below:
          <img src="images/IntroCAD_Image_2.png" alt="IntroCAD2" />
          <br />
          You can now start your sketch. Whatever you sketch here can be
          "extruded" into the 3rd dimension: after finishing your sketch,
          press the "finish sketch" button in the top right corner; then, next
          to the "Start 2D Sketch" button, click the "extrude" button.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="images/IntroCAD_Image_3.png" alt="IntroCAD3" />
          <br />
          This gives you a few options. You can select a face to extrude, as
          well as a direction to extrude in. Under output, you have some
          boolean options: The first two are the most commonly used, allowing
          you to switch between a solid or a hole. After making an extrusion,
          you can select its faces to make sketches on. There's a lot more to
          Inventor (like dimensions and such), this is just a little bit of
          what it can do.
          <br />
          <br />
          With both of these programs, you can create amazing things. CAD has
          limitless possibilities and applications; Even outside of specific
          engineering fields, it can be used in

          </a>
          In summary, CAD is a really cool way to make abstract ideas and
          concepts come to life!

          This was the meeting where we first put our CAD skills to use. Our
          goal was to design a 3D model of a car with a cutout for a pipe
          running through the back of the car and up through a nozzle (see
          image below). After the model was 3D printed, a balloon would be
          attached to the top part of the nozzle, which would propel the car
          forward.
          <br /><br />
          <img src="images/BalloonCar_Image_1.png" alt="Car1" />
          The car chassis would have two holes for the axles to pass through,
          and wheels would be attached to the axles (after all, it wouldn't be
          a good car without wheels). The result would be something like this:
          <br /><br />

          <br />
          During the fourth meeting, I 3D printed some of the student’s cars,
          and we raced them virtually. Two of the cars can be seen up top,
          which were made by Marco and Vasco Klap.

          <br />
          On the fifth meeting (2/1/2021) we designed model houses. My example
          house was made to scale to a real house.
          <!--(You can read more about the real-life connections under #NerdStuff) -->.
          This meeting was a little less structured, with me explaining what I
          was doing as we went, with students following along making whatever
          creative changes they deemed worthy (as can be seen above, in a
          model house made by Emma Viglotti). I started with a 150x150x24 mm
          box and cut out a portion of it to make an L shape. Then I hollowed
          out part of the L shape to make a garage.
          <br />
          <img src="images/House_Image_1.png" alt="House2" />
          <br />
          Afterwards, roofs were added using two triangles, an area was cut
          out for the porch, and a little outline was made to indicate a door.
          <br />
          <img src="images/House_Image_2.png" alt="House3" />
          <br />
          Then I added a window, and some solar panels (because why not). At
          this point, one student informed me that I could change the color of
          the house by clicking the “solid” button in the block options menu.
          And thus, my new beautiful pink house was finished. But it still
          needed something… so I added a shower to the garage. As for why...
          Well, why not?
